      <div class="bio__header">According to OfficialCharts.com, the Rolling Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time.</div>

      <p class="bio__copy">Their top single is <cite>"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"</cite>, regarded by many at the time as <cite>"the classic example of rock and roll"</cite>. The Stones contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own "codewords" and slang, such as "losing streak" for menstrual period, which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs. The band has been viewed as the musical "vanguard of a major transfusion" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain. Muddy Waters was quoted as saying that the Rolling Stones and other English bands piqued the interest of American youth in blues musicians. After they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums —and those of other blues musicians— increased public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music.</p>

In <time datetime="201305">May 2013</time>, Rolling Stone magazine declared them the "most definitional band that rock & roll has produced". The Telegraph has called Mick Jagger "the Rolling Stone who changed music". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in <time datetime="1989">1989</time>. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the "whole business model of popular music" and are tied with Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams for the second most Number 1 albums on the Official UK Chart, surpassed only by the Beatles. In a review of the band's <time datetime="2020">2020</time> acoustic rendition of "You Can't Always Get What You Want" for Global Citizen's One World: Together At Home on-line and on-screen concert, Billboard stated that they are "still the masters of delivering unforgettable live performances."</p>

          <div class="quote__text">The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'</div>

      <p class="bio__copy">The band has received, and been nominated for multiple awards during their 57 years together including: three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and <abbr title="New Muscal Express">NME</abbr> awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary <cite>Crossfire Hurricane</cite>.</p>

      <p class="bio__copy">On Jagger's 75th birthday, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, <cite>Petroperla mickjaggeri</cite> and <cite>Lapisperla keithrichardsi</cite>, were placed within a new family <cite>Petroperlidae</cite>. The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek <span lang="gr">"petra"</span> that stands for "stone". The scientists referred to the fossils as "Rolling Stoneflies". This theme was continued when <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> named a rock disturbed by the thrusters of the Mars InSight Lander "Rolling Stones Rock", as announced by Robert Downey Jr. during the band's <time datetime="20190822">22 August 2019</time> performance in Pasadena, California.</p>
